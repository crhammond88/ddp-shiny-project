## Linear Exploration Application

Welcome!

This application was created as my course project for the Developing Data Products class from John Hopkins University and Coursera. The reproducible pitch presentation for this project is available on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/crhammond88/ddp-shiny-project). The application is hosted at [shinyapps.io](https://crhammond88.shinyapps.io/Linear_Calculator/).
