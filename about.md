## Linear Exploration

Welcome! 

Steps to use the application:

1. Click on the Explore tab above and then select the Plot subtab. The Plot section will be selected by default.
1. Select a dataset. The Kepler Exoplanet dataset is selected by default.
2. Select the X and Y variables. By default, the first two variables in the dataset will be used.
  + Some datasets included only contain two variables.
3. Enter the number of clusters desired for k-means clustering. The default is 5. 
4. Explore the data. 
  + The application creates a linear regression line for the variables selected and visualizes the k-means clusters.
5. Examine the summary and data subtabs for more detail.
  + The data subtab takes slightly longer to load than the other tabs.


Kepler candidate planet data can be found [here](http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/). The other datasets are available as part of the [R datasets package](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html). 

This application was created as my course project for the Developing Data Products class from John Hopkins University and Coursera. The reproducible pitch presentation for this project is available on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/crhammond88/ddp-shiny-project). Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/crhammond88/ddp-shiny-project).
